In this workshop, we hope to introduce some of the general concepts in open science and reproducible research and discuss relevant tools in R and RStudio.  For each of the lessons there is a blog post that describes what we are doing, provides examples and hands-on exercises.  We have written these as blog posts for use after the workshop. During the workshop, we will provide brief explanations, live coding, and as many hands-on exercises as we can fit in.  After the workshop you won't be an expert in R or reproducible research but should have a good starting place for using reproducible research and open science tools in your own research.
